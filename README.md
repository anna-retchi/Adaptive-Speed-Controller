# Adaptive-Speed-Controller
We have built a prototype of a system that controls the speed of a vehicle automatically when the vehicle enters a speed restriction zone.
## Features
- Wireless control of vehicle speed
- Real-time LCD and audio feedback
- Simple and practical Arduino-based implementation

## How It Works
The system uses a wireless transmitter to send control signals to a receiver, which processes them and adjusts the motor speed accordingly. The LCD displays system status and a speaker provides sound feedback. It demonstrates the concept of adaptive speed control using basic embedded systems.

## How to Use
1. Upload the `ArduinoCode` to the Arduino Nano.
2. Connect all components based on the provided circuit diagrams.
3. Power the system using a 7.4V battery.
4. Operate the transmitter to control speed.
5. Observe real-time output on the display and motor behavior.
